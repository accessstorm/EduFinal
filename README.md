# EduFinal
The process design of the EduConnect system ensures seamless interaction between users and the backend, facilitating content creation, management, and interaction. Starting with user authentication and registration, users input their details during registration, which is validated using Django’s contrib.auth system. Successful registration stores user data in the database, assigning each user a unique ID. Once logged in, users are given personalized access, allowing them to create, edit, and delete their posts, while non-registered users can only view the content.

For post creation and management, users utilize a rich text editor (CKEditor) to create posts, adding text, images, HTML code (escaped), and various formatting options. Once submitted, the backend validates the post and stores it in the database, automatically appending user-specific data, such as the username and timestamp. These posts are displayed on the homepage, with new posts appearing at the top. Post management allows users to edit or delete their own content, while permissions ensure that only the post creator can modify or delete a post.

In terms of post viewing and interaction, logged-in users can fully interact with the posts, including the ability to like or unlike them, while non-registered users can only view the posts without further interaction. Backend permission checks ensure that users can only edit or delete their own posts, and if a user is logged out, they are prevented from accessing any previously copied URLs to edit or delete posts.

The system also features category management, where users can create new categories, and the backend generates slugified URLs for better SEO and user experience. Once a category is created, it becomes fully integrated with the post display system, allowing users to view all posts related to a specific category on a dedicated page. The system also includes post editing and deletion features. When a user selects a post to edit or delete, their permission is checked through their user ID. If authorized, the user can make changes or delete the post permanently, with the changes being reflected immediately.

Security is a key aspect of the design, especially with URL routing. The system uses slugified URLs for better navigation, while also ensuring that unauthorized users, such as those who are logged out, cannot access restricted URLs for editing or deleting posts. Lastly, the system integrates time zone management, tagging posts with the Asia/Kolkata time zone to ensure accurate time display across posts, providing consistency in viewing timestamps. Overall, this process design ensures a secure, user-friendly experience with robust content management and interaction capabilities.
